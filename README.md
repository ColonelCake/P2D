# P2D

This project is a programming language called P2D, which stands for platform 2D and is used to create simple 2D video games.


# Introduction

In many introductory programming courses, students are not immediately handed a compiler to learn the basics of programming. Instead, they are handed tools like Carnegie-Mellonâ€™s Alice, drag and drop programming tools that can illustrate programming principles through an interactive medium. Alice does this by using programming statements such as for loops, else-if, do-whiles, etc. to animate small videos. GameSalad is another such program, this time aimed at teaching videogame programming to newcomers. We set out to develop a language to not only help create 2D games, but one that would serve as a transition for programming students that learned programming using these programs instead of compilers, illustrating the power of compilers and the degree of control one can have in programming outside of a pre-determined environment.
                
# Guide:

The language consists of declaring levels, and within those levels you declare all of the game objects that will be displayed in the level.
To finish declaring the level with all its objects, type "end" which is the delimiter.


There are four types of objects in the language:
1. Player:
    This object has WASD keys preassigned to movement, so that the player can move the character.
2. Mob:
    This object represents enemies, which will kill the player if it comes into contact with him.
3. Object:
    This represents a normal object in the game and its attributes can be customized to reflect how it behaves when it comes 
    into contact with other types.
4. Goal:
    This object represents the goal of the level. If the player touches it, the level is complete.
5. Behaviour:
    This represents the movement behavior of other objects to which it is assigned as an attribute. All preassigned movement and
    behaviors are specified with this type.


Each of these objects have to be declared inside a level and their attributes must be specified as such: Typename(atrr1, atrr2,...)
These attributes can be strings, integers, True or False, floats, or other TypeDeclarations of objects.

The attributes for each object are:
1. Player(xPosition(integer), yPosition(integer), imagePath(String), Behaviour(TypeDeclaration))
2. Mob(xPosition(integer), yPosition(integer), imagePath(String), Behaviour(TypeDeclaration))
3. Object(xPosition(integer), yPosition(integer), imagePath(String), Behaviour(TypeDeclaration))
4. Goal(xPosition(integer), yPosition(integer), imagePath(String), Behaviour(TypeDeclaration))
5. Behaviour(xMovement(integer), yMovement(integer), Speed(float), MovementCharacteristic(LOOP, CONTINUOUS, or DEFAULT), Gravity(boolean))
6. Level(Name(String))

# How To Run:

To run your code, write it in a text file and when you run the parse.py python script, write the name of the file(if in same directory)
or the path to the file.
